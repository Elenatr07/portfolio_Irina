                        where students frequently place large orders. Recognizing the demand and convenience of online ordering, 
                        the client wants a platform that allows students to easily place their orders online, ensuring a  seamless and efficient ordering experience at any time of the day or night.</p>

                    <p class="project_text_bakery">While our 24/7 Shawarma place caters to a diverse audience, 
                        including  many foreign students, the language barrier can pose challenges when  ordering food without clear visualizations of menu items. 
                        This can lead  to confusion, incorrect orders, and a less-than-optimal customer  experience, highlighting the need for a solution that addresses language  
                        barriers and enhances menu visibility for all customers, regardless of  language proficiency.</p>

                <h3 class="central_block_bakery_header">The Solution</h3>
                <p class="central_block_bakery_text">I created a responsive design for 24/7  Shawarma platform, 
                    featuring clear and visually appealing menu visualizations.  
                    This design ensures that users, including foreign students, 
                    can easily  understand and select items when placing orders. Additionally, 
                    I  implemented a streamlined process for placing large orders, 
                    complete  with options to customize items based on individual preferences. 
                    This  approach enhances the ordering experience, facilitates efficient order  placement, 
                    and caters to the diverse needs of customer base.</p>

                   <p class="project_text_bakery">I crafted a single-section layout for the platform, 
                    showcasing large images of menu items for easy horizontal scrolling and selection. 
                    A sidebar on the left lists selected items and shows the total price, 
                    giving users a clear order overview. Furthermore, I integrated a progress indicator, 
                    ensuring users are informed about the remaining steps to complete their order, 
                    thereby enhancing transparency and guiding them through the process seamlessly.</p>

                    I incorporated an additional step for order customization. 
                    Depending on the product category, users can add desired ingredients for some items or remove unwanted ingredients 
                    for others, such as salads. This customization step ensures that users can tailor their orders precisely to their preferences,
