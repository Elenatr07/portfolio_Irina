                        lacks an online platform to effectively  showcase its services, 
                        differentiate itself from competitors, and  provide a convenient booking system. 
                        This hinders their ability to  attract and retain customers in a competitive market.</p>

                    <p class="project_text_bakery_left">Potential customers prioritize convenience and ease of booking  appointments when choosing a massage salon. 
                        They seek unique and  specialized services that set one salon apart from another. 
                        Online  visibility and a professional website play a significant role in  influencing customers' perceptions and decisions. 
                        Clear and concise  information about services, pricing, and availability is crucial for  users to make informed choices and book appointments confidently.</p>

                <h3 class="central_block_bakery_header">The Solution</h3>
                <p class="central_block_bakery_text">I created a responsive website design that addresses all these  challenges. 
                    The design prioritizes ease of use and seamless navigation  for convenient appointment booking. 
                    It highlights ZenHarmony's unique  services, effectively differentiating them from competitors. 
                    The  responsive layout ensures optimal viewing across devices, enhancing  online visibility and user experience. 
                    Clear and concise information is  prominently displayed, empowering users to make informed decisions and  book appointments with confidence.</p>

                   <h3 class="project_header_bakery_central">Style and colour decisions </h3>
                   <p class="project_text_bakery">I proposed a colour scheme of very dark brown with cream/orange elements  instead of a completely black website for the client. 
                    This choice  creates a warm and inviting atmosphere. However, to ensure readability,  especially for excessive reading, 
                    I minimized the amount of text and  focused on making the design more visually appealing.</p>

                    For those who prefer not to make phone calls, I added  an option to confirm appointments via email, providing a convenient and  flexible booking experience.</p>

                Users can easily find detailed information about a service they're interested in, including prices and core benefits, by expanding the relevant section. 
                This streamlined approach enhances user experience and facilitates informed decision-making.</p>
